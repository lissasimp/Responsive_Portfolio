# Responsive_Portfolio

This project is about creating a portfolio of work to **showcase my skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position.** THis portfolio highlights my work to date as well as the thought processes behind it. This portfolio will be added to and developed as my own personal knowledge deepens and I have my projects to showcase to potential employers.
